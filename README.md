# PaperSummary

PaperSummary is a gem that gets a publication's summary by accessing eLife's content. We'll add more sources as we go along.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'paper_summary'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install paper_summary

## Usage

You can use PaperSummary like this:

    result = PaperSummary.summary_for('doi:10.7554/eLife.00013')

The result will be a hash similar to this one:

    { summary_text: 'Short summary text',
      summary_html: '<p>Short summary html</p>'
    }
